# vibe-check

A skill for AI coding tools that guides complete beginners from a vague app idea to a buildable blueprint.

**grill-me is for engineers. vibe-check is for everyone else.**

## What it does

When someone who's never coded before says "I want to build an app that does X," this skill turns their AI tool into a patient mentor that:

1. **Discovers what they actually need** — not features, but the real problem they're solving
2. **Maps the entire user experience** — happy flows, failure flows, and edge cases
3. **Surfaces decisions they don't know they need to make** — auth, databases, payments, hosting, legal
4. **Recommends a modern tech stack** — with plain-language explanations of what each piece does and why
5. **Produces a complete plan document** — structured as the AI coding tool's onboarding manual
6. **Includes build checkpoints** — so the beginner is never lost during construction. The AI stops after each phase to explain what was just built, why, and what's next.

## Who it's for

- People who have an app idea but have never built software
- "Vibe coders" who can get something working on their screen but need help thinking through the full picture
- Anyone who wants to go from idea → structured plan before touching code

## How to use it

### With Claude Code

Copy the `skills/vibe-check/` folder into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory (or wherever your agent reads skills from), then tell Claude:

```
Use the vibe-check skill to help me plan my app.
```

### With other AI tools

Copy the contents of `skills/vibe-check/SKILL.md` into your AI tool's system prompt or project instructions.

## What the skill produces

By the end of a vibe-check session, you'll have a plan document that includes:

- **Problem statement** — in your own words
- **User flows** — mermaid diagrams for happy path, failure path, and edge cases
- **Feature breakdown** — V1 (build now) vs V2+ (build later)
- **System architecture** — visual diagram with beginner-friendly labels
- **Tech stack** — every tool, what it does, why it was chosen, what it costs
- **Data model** — what gets stored, in plain language
- **Cost breakdown** — monthly estimates with free tier details
- **Pre-launch checklists** — security, legal, accessibility
- **Build phases with checkpoints** — numbered phases with guided explanations at every step

This plan is designed to be handed directly to your AI coding tool to start building.
