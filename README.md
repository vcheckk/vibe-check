# vibe-check

A skill for AI coding tools that guides complete beginners from a vague app idea to a buildable blueprint.

**grill-me is for engineers. vibe-check is for everyone else.**

## What it does

When someone who's never coded before says "I want to build an app that does X," this skill turns their AI tool into a patient mentor that:

1. **Discovers what they actually need**: not features, but the real problem they're solving (Reddit pain-mining, a competitor gap analysis, and ODI opportunity scoring)
2. **Maps the entire user experience**: happy flows, failure flows, and edge cases
3. **Surfaces decisions they don't know they need to make**: auth, databases, payments, hosting, legal
4. **Recommends a modern tech stack**: with plain-language explanations of what each piece does and why
5. **Produces a complete plan document**: structured as the AI coding tool's onboarding manual, plus a **visual HTML blueprint** the human opens in their browser
6. **Includes build checkpoints**: so the beginner is never lost during construction. The AI stops after each phase to explain what was just built, why, and what's next.
7. **Teaches the build-time basics** in language for someone who has never touched code: local vs. GitHub vs. live, how to save and back up code (commit/push/deploy), and keeping secret keys safe.
8. **Finds a growth loop**: how the app recruits its next user on its own, preferably viral and organic, built into the core flow rather than bolted on, so growth compounds instead of needing a constant push.
9. **Keeps the app healthy as it grows**: a **Checkup Mode** that gently looks over a messy, grown codebase and tidies it safely, so the AI keeps building cleanly instead of breaking things.

## Who it's for

- People who have an app idea but have never built software
- "Vibe coders" who can get something working on their screen but need help thinking through the full picture
- Anyone who wants to go from idea → structured plan before touching code

## How to use it

### With Claude Code

Run this in your project root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TexasBedouin/vibe-check .claude/skills/vibe-check
```

Then tell Claude:

```
Use the vibe-check skill to help me plan my app.
```

To update to the latest version later, run `git pull` inside `.claude/skills/vibe-check`.

### With other AI tools

Copy the contents of `SKILL.md` into your AI tool's system prompt or project instructions.

## What the skill produces

By the end of a vibe-check session, you'll have a plan document that includes:

- **Problem statement**: in your own words
- **User flows**: mermaid diagrams for happy path, failure path, and edge cases
- **Feature breakdown**: V1 (build now) vs V2+ (build later)
- **System architecture**: visual diagram with beginner-friendly labels
- **Tech stack**: every tool, what it does, why it was chosen, what it costs
- **Data model**: what gets stored, in plain language
- **Cost breakdown**: monthly estimates with free tier details
- **Pre-launch checklists**: security, legal, accessibility
- **Growth loop**: the one way the app brings in its next user on its own, plus the number that proves it's working
- **Build phases with checkpoints**: numbered phases with guided explanations at every step

This plan is designed to be handed directly to your AI coding tool to start building.

## Version

Current version: **1.7.2** (see [VERSION](VERSION) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).

When you use vibe-check, it does a quick best-effort check for a newer version and tells you if you're behind. To update, run `git pull` inside `.claude/skills/vibe-check`. Versioning is semantic (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

## Who made this

Built by Amer Arab. I spent 12-plus years as a product manager, most of it taking products from zero to one. Discovery is the part I care about most: working out whether a problem is real before anyone writes a line of code, then shaping something people actually want instead of something that merely works. Those years were also spent shoulder to shoulder with engineers, which is where the "you're the PM, the AI is the engineer" idea at the heart of this skill comes from. vibe-check is me handing a first-timer the instincts I had to learn the hard way.
